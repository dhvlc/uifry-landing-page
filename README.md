Design Choices and Libraries Used
---------------------------------

The website was designed with a modern and clean aesthetic, using a color scheme of black, white, and red. The font used throughout the website is Roboto, which was imported from Google Fonts. Dark Mode Switch Button available.

The website uses the following libraries:

* AOS: A library for animating elements on scroll. It was used to add subtle animations to the sections as the user scrolls down the page.
* Font Awesome: A library of icons used throughout the website, such as in the navigation menu and the features section.

The website also uses some custom JavaScript code to handle the navigation menu toggle, smooth scrolling to sections, and the dark mode toggle.
